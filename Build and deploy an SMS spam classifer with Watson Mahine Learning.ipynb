Load data <a id=\"load\"></a>\nFirst, install the Watson Machine Learning library via `pip` if you have not yet installed it. <br> We will use this library to communicate with Watson Machine Learning. The `python client` allows anyone with a Watson Machine Learning instance to programmatically save, load, and deploy models, among other tasks. ",

In order to do this, we will persist models with Watson Machine Learning. With WML, you can easily `save` and `deploy` models, among other powerful features. `Saving` a model makes this model portable -- as long as you can connect to WML, you can load your saved models into your environment. `Deploying` a model exposes the predictive capacity of the model as an API endpoint, which you can consume in applications, for example. \n\nUse the client to save your model to the WML Repository. From there, you can load and deploy models as well. If you don't already have a WML account, you can get more details [here](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-setup.html?audience=wdp&context=analytics).\n\nFirst, we will import the library and specify our credentials. If you don't know where to find your credentials, they are available to you both in the Watson Studio Project and in IBM Cloud. ",
